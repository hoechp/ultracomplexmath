# ultracomplexmath
Hardcore math library with many features - regarding 'ultracomplex' math - you'll never find anywhere else. Don't get me wrong - the images you see won't blow your mind - it's more like that these things even can be computed by a library.

## Topic
It started with the three base types of hypercomplex numbers.
- complex (imaginary times itself equals -1)
- binary (imaginary times itself equals 1 - but isn't 1 itself)
- dual (imaginary times itself equals 0 - but isn't 0 itself)

But eventually it was about all it's combinations, too. A single number then has 8 dimensions - each one corresponding with all other dimensions in a unique way. Then I implemented pretty much all mathematical operations for them - which is anything other than trivial by the way. But right there it'll get too complex, better just look at these first pictures:

And then there's a function plotter showing different dimensions of an 8-dimensional function that shows basically the eulerian behaviour of each base-algebra.
